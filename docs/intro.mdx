## Get working with NativeFlow

Hellow, we're NativeFlow, building a dependency-free approach, which builds from bottom up and gives you and your team a beter syntax to work around with.

We're glad to have you!

## Benefits we Offer?

- Closer to how stylesheets in React Native 'are meant to be'
- Objects instead of <s>classes</s> (literally **literals**)
- You can extend the library to your liking / build your own fork of NativeFlow
- Syntax similar to Tailwind so lesser learning curve

## Platform-specific symbols
- *âœ±* Android
- *â˜…* iOS

## Similarities with Tailwind

- 'Almost' same utility names for objects
- Similar environment setup (custom prettier-plugin && Intellisense under development)
